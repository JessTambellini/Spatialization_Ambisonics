1. Write a paragraph describing the piece you plan to perform in Littlefield Hall on May 2nd.  
Start the description with an aesthetic goal, and then describe the code you are developing to realize it.  
Include the location in the hall where you will be performing it (such as at the mixing console, or on stage, or ...), 
and how many and which speakers you plan to use in the performance.  Include an approximate duration.

2. When will you be ready to perform a first version of the piece in the class in Littlefield?  
Choose any date when we have class before May 2nd.

3. What instruments and tech requirements will you need for the performance and the rehearsal?

4. Upload a folder titled "Final Project - Your Name" to this repository.  Put any code into it that you are using
to develop your piece, and continue to revise it every week with your latest versions!
